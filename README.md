# MusicalStudentsGroup
Application for students in underprivileged music programs to receive instruments, get lessons, or form a music group such as a band, orchestra, or choir

The intent with all of these functions is to make sure that students in school districts with a limited number of instruments can play an instrument on a regular basis. Additionally, lessons can serve as additional teaching for younger students, which will overall strengthen the performance of the program as a whole while providing older students with an opportunity to volunteer and give back. Students will be able to form musical groups based on their interests to expand their musical horizons by playing in groups that aren't offered in underfunded school districts such as a jazz combo or string quintet. This will also help them learn multiple styles of music.

All code for the Ruby on Rails application is included in the src folder. Project proposal is in the docs folder and will include future documents that I create.

AS OF 2-24:
Stubs for the program can be found in MusicApp/app/views/pages in the files home.html.erb, lessons.html.erb, instruments.html.erb, and formaGroup.html.erb. This is the temporary location for these stubs, I have included them here so I can recognize which method is going to go on what page when I am focusing on implementation at a later date. The homepage is also incomplete, it just has some sample text.
