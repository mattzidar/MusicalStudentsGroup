# MusicalStudentsGroup

Application for students in underprivileged music programs to receive instruments, get lessons, or form a music group such as a band, orchestra, or choir

The intent with all of these functions is to make sure that students in school districts with a limited number of instruments can play an instrument on a regular basis. Additionally, lessons can serve as additional teaching for younger students, which will overall strengthen the performance of the program as a whole while providing older students and teachers with an opportunity to volunteer. Students will be able to form musical groups based on their interests that aren't offered in their school district. This app will be used by school teachers to manage requests for instruments, lessons, and student groups.

All code that I could add for the Ruby on Rails application is included in the src folder. Project proposal is in the docs folder along with documentation and diagrams for my project.
