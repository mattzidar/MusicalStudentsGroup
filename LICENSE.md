Communication about bugs, issues, future changes and features must be done through the issues tab. Discussion can be completed there and issues must be resolved as issues are fixed or conversation has ended. Any discussion or ideas can be listed in the issues tab as well.

In order to develop future functionality or fix bugs, please first refer to the installation guide in the README.md file or on the home page of this wiki. After installation and changes have been made to the code, make sure to commit the changes to the development branch in this Github repository. Make sure to follow the format of the coding style and code structure itself (model, view, controller). After changes have been made in the development branch, they will be reviewed to see if the changes should be merged with the files on the main branch.
